# Natours - CSS Project

## Main idea
This projects contains a lot of  CSS animations and other features. It is the first project I accomplished from the course  "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" on Udemy.com by  Jonas Schmedtmann. 
Do not let the amount of animations scare you - the main purpose of this project was to learn more about CSS animations (and other cool properties).
